# Nodestream
> Nodestream is a declarative framework for Building, Maintaining, and Analyzing Data in a Graph Database.

## 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction 
`nodestream-proj` is a all about faciliating the power of Graph Databases. 
The central library, `nodestream` focuses on delcarative ingestion into graph databases. 
On top of that, we have an ecosystem of plugins to extend nodestream with optional (yet awesome) additional functionality. 
Plugins range from simple developer features like adding support for `.env` files all the way to complete pipelines that allow you to ingest data from different places.
